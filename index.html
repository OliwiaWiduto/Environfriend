                        This research aims to identify the impact of the <b>tech sector</b> on our planet and establish the most <b>sustainable digital practices in 2020</b>. To do this, it analyses software used by prominent <span class="highlight">Belfast based tech companies</span>. This data was gathered through a <i>surveymonkey questionnaire</i>, broken down into 9 main categories of tool use case. The questionnaire was completed by <b>32 companies</b> from a list of Northern Ireland based companies with designers<a class="footnote"></a>, crowdsourced by members of popular Slack group, <i>NI Design Chat</i>. Results were rounded to the nearest 0.5%.

It’s like we’re at level 99 of a game. Think of greenhouse gases as expansion packs. If we continue adding them at the rate we have been over the past 80 years, the climate will force us to go back to level 1.

                        To put it succinctly, global warming occurs when the sun's heat energy cannot escape the earth's atmosphere. The earth is forced to change this energy into another form of energy: this is how weather patterns are created. Some of this energy goes back out into space through the energy escape hatch, but this hatch is becoming increasingly blocked by greenhouse gases. <span class="highlight">As more and more heat is trapped, weather patterns get more and more extreme.</span>

                        <i>“Sustainability is most often defined as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

The aim is to reach a near perfect <b>equilibrium</b> across all 3 pillars.

                        <a class="footnote"></a>
                        That number appears deceptively low and may suggest the tech sector does not have responsibility in this area. However, this figure is equal to the amount of greenhouse gas pollution produced by fuel from the <b>>aviation industry</b> - an industry which is often cited as one of the most environmentally problematic.

                    <p>
                        Today, cloud computing forms the very basis of the internet. <i>“Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers to store, manage, and process data.”</i>
                        <a class="footnote"></a>
                        Every time we query google or reply to a message in Slack we <span class="highlight">download and upload information to servers</span> around the world, a process known as <i>“data transfer”</i>. This information is computed in a data center, defined as <i>“a large group of networked computer servers”</i> <a class="footnote"></a>
                        Today, there are approximately <b>500 data centers</b> which store our information.
                        <a class="footnote"></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although data centers are branded as <i>“the cloud”</i>, they are not metaphysical bodies in the stratosphere. When we save data to the cloud, it is in fact transferred to very physical data centers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019 it was estimated across all data centers we are storing <b>10–50 zettabytes of data</b>. <i>“A zettabyte is a measure of storage capacity, which equals 1000⁷ (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes)</i>. By 2025 this is estimated to grow to the range of 150–200 zettabytes.” <a class="footnote"></a>An Atlanta based hyperscale data farm owned by H5 Data Centers, is nearly 186,000m<sub>2</sub> large - packed with physical servers. <a class="footnote"></a> That’s nearly <b>35 football fields of servers</b>. This is precisely what makes the 150–200 zettabytes so concerning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Harnessing immense computational power, data centers consume colossal amounts of electricity. Moreover, when we transfer data it travels through a network of cables, once again powered by electricity. This electricity is derived from the <highlight class="span">power grid</highlight>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire infrastructure of technology relies on the power grid. <i>“The power grid is a network of power lines and associated equipment used to transmit and distribute electricity over a geographic area.”</i> <a class="footnote"></a>Between July 2019 and June 2020, Northern Ireland consumed <b>7,505 Gigawatt hours (GWh)</b> of electricity. 52.3% (3928 GWh) of this electricity came from <b>fossil fuels</b>.
                        <a class="footnote"></a>
                        <b>Fossil fuels produce carbon when they are burned.</b> 1 gigawatt hour of electricity produced from fossil fuels generates 430 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.<a class="footnote"></a>Establishing exactly how much electricity the internet uses is an impossible task, but for this example we will use the 2% of global electricity usage figure from the 2020 IEA report. <a class="footnote"></a>

                    <p>
                        Before embedding Google Analytics or Hotjar out of habit, we can run an <b>ideation session</b> (by ourselves or with our team) to determine what heuristics will help us better understand user behaviour in order to improve our product. This will shed light on exactly what data needs to be synthesised once it is collected, speeding up our workflow. Once we get what we need out of it: <span class="highlight">scrap it, don’t store it</span>. By doing this, we decrease the amount of data we store in data centers, in turn using less servers, which means using less electricity and therefore producing less carbon.

                        I used Notion to create a wiki for this dissertation. The wiki was comprised of links, text and roughly 20 images. I exported the data and found I’d generated 7.2MB in 1 week . <span class="highlight">In contrast to the link based wiki, Gerry McGovern’s book, “World Wide Waste” which covers this topic in much more depth weighs only 348 KB</span>. Moreover, it isn’t transferred back and forth between our computer and Kansas, creating unnecessary pollution.

                        To cut out the incessant data transfer of cloud note taking apps like Notion, we can switch to products like Apple Notes or Microsoft OneNote which give us the option to opt out of cloud storage. <a class="footnote"></a>

                        The same logic can be applied to storing and creating data using the Google Suite. While Google data centers are powered by renewable energy, when we transfer data, <b>carbon is still generated in the power grid</b>. 75% of Belfast based companies use Google Docs, 55% Google Sheets, 55% Google Slides and 13% Forms.

                        If we don’t need to share a document with the wider team, there is <b>no need to store it in a data center</b>. Instead, we can use local applications like the Microsoft or Apple suite cancelling out the transfer of data and creation of CO<sub>2</sub> altogether. If we decide we do need to share the document, we can always upload it to Google Drive.

                    <p>
                        If we are already storing a lot of documents in Google Drive, we can employ a methodology such as Gerry McGovern's <a href="https://gerrymcgovern.com/books/top-tasks-a-how-to-guide/">Top Tasks</a> Endorsed by Toyota and IBM, this approach helps us determine our users' goals. By employing this tactic, we can <b>get rid of data</b> which doesn't bring the user and by proxy, ourselves, towards achieving these goals. As an added bonus we are improving our teams efficiency; no longer needing to wade through irrelevant documents to get to what we need. [G McG]

                        Another step we can take is using <b>Creative Cloud offline</b>. 39% of Belfast based companies use Illustrator, 23% use AfterEffects and 19% use Photoshop. All Adobe Software is installed locally, however it automatically runs Creative Cloud in the background. Using Activity Monitor once again, we can determine Creative Cloud and it’s counterparts were among the most power and network hungry processes during that session. While .psd & .ai files are very large, they become much smaller once exported.

                        To avoid this transfer of information, we can store working files locally, and share compressed <i>.jpg</i> or <i>.svg</i> <a class="footnote"></a>files with our team only when necessary.

                        <i>React.js</i> is an increasingly popular framework. In most cases this language renders html pages <b>server side</b>. The key difference between react and php applications, is that PHP applications render page by page on a request basis, while <span class="highlight">react sends code for the entire application on the initial request</span>. When we navigate to a new page, the react application populates content data by contacting a <b>backend API</b>, but the bones of the website stay in place from the initial download. Reddit is one example of an application which uses this technology.<a class="footnote"></a>Using the same methodology as the previous framework example, the download sizes of 4 Reddit pages were 637KB, 419KB, 11KB and 22KB. This makes the average Reddit page 0.27225MB.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Comparing this to Etsy’s 2.25MB average, we can conclude the amount of data transferred on average by react based Reddit, is <b>10 times smaller than PHP based Etsy</b>. If less data is transferred, less electricity is used and in turn, less carbon is emitted. This makes react a much more environmentally friendly framework.

                        Section 2 established that data centers produce carbon through electricity consumption, but that is not the end. Another complication with data centers is the <b>hardware</b> they use; namely, servers. On average, servers are replaced every 3 years.<a class="footnote"></a>

                        It is becoming increasingly evident that tech manufacturing companies produce assets with a <b>fixed term shelf life</b>. Moore's Law states “<i>the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, though the cost of computers is halved.</i>” <a class="footnote"></a> This means that every 2 years computers become twice as fast, while their cost is cut in half. The side effect of these exponential advancements is <b>planned obsolescence</b>. “<i>Planned obsolescence describes a strategy of deliberately ensuring that the current version of a given product will become out of date or useless within a known time period.</i>” <a class="footnote"></a> As of 2019, 50 tonnes of electric device waste were produced annually.<a class="footnote"></a> This is the result of planned obsolescence.

                    <p>
                        Planned obsolescence does not stop at hardware. On the contrary, the effect is crystal clear in software development too. Tactics like <i>agile development, sprints</i> and <i>iteration</i> force us to sink more time, energy and electricity to develop minimum viable products round the clock.<a class="footnote"></a><a class="footnote"></a>

Subporting software in IE11 is a running joke amongst developers.<a class="footnote"></a> The browser is outdated and doesn’t subport a lot of essential contemporary functionality. This is concerning, because <span class="highlight">IE was released only 7 years ago, on October 17, 2013.<a class="footnote"></a> In 2021, it is becoming deprecated.</span> <a class="footnote"></a> That’s a lifespan of only 8 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Behind every product there are hours of work and gigawatts of power. When we kill IE, <i>what are we really putting a line through?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is estimated that 1000+ developers<a class="footnote"></a> worked on IE11. Let’s assume each developer worked for 7 hours a day for 46 weeks. That’s 1.6 million hours of human life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>Let’s say every employee used a Lenovo w530 laptop <a class="footnote"></a>
                        <a class="footnote"></a>which has a battery life of 6 hours and 23 minutes <a class="footnote"></a>, so it needs to be charged once a day for an average of 4 hours <a class="footnote"></a> at (20 V x 8.5 A = 170W) 170 watts<a class="footnote"></a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="maths">
                        4 hours x 170 watts = 680Wh
                    </p>
                    <p class="maths">
                        680Wh x 1000 people = 680,000Wh every day.

                    <p class="maths">
                        680,000Wh x 46 weeks = 31,280,000Wh

                    <p>
                        In 2018 it was estimated that <b>1 gigawatt hour</b> of electricity produced from fossil fuels generates <b>430 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub></b>. <a class="footnote"></a> If the electric grid was 100% fossil fuels at the time, that’s 13.45 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>. These figures account for charging the laptop alone, not including electricity needed to power all internet related activities.

                    <p class="maths">

                        0.03128 Gwh x 430 tonnes = 13.45 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we make IE obsolete, what we are really disposing of is <b>1.6 million workforce hours</b> and <b>31,280,000 Wh</b> of electricity. <span class="highlight">What we create instead, is a 13.45 CO<sub>2 </sub>tonne decrease in the quality of life on the only planet in the solar system which subports human life.</span>

                        Unlike IE11, we want our products to withstand the test of time. How do we avoid sinking our own, as well as the earth’s resources into a product which doesn’t last?

                    <p>
                        This is a broad question far beyond sustainability. However, we can narrow it down by looking at constraints which will help us release as little carbon as possible in the process of making a web application. Designers play one of the biggest roles in shaping products, so let’s take a look at what design can do to decrease carbon emissions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “<i>As a designer, you are the director of carbon emissions</i>” - Asim Hussein, LCAW 2020<a class="footnote"></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Among the participants of the primary research questionnaire, at 52% Sketch is the most popular design software. Figma (39%) is catching up, followed by InDesign (23%), Adobe XD (16%), Abstract (13%) and Zeplin (10%) and Invision (6%).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Wireframes</b> and <b>prototypes</b> are intended to be used only during the build process: once they have served their purpose, they will become obsolete. Thus, they fall into the category of <b>planned obsolescence</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">Most of the above software stores our assets in the cloud automatically.</span> Some of us choose to save assets locally, but once we send a link to our team or client to view or collaborate, that asset is stored in the cloud. In the same way as any other web application, this process produces CO<sub>2</sub> through the transfer of data like <b>large images, vast amounts of text</b> and <b>complex code</b>. <a class="footnote"></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of surrendering to popular design patterns such as the heavyweight hero banner, we can ask ourselves, “<i>Does an image help the user achieve their goal?</i>” If the answer is “no”, there’s a better way of filling that space: this could be <b>white space, text, a vector graphic</b> and beyond. By doing this, we emit less CO<sub>2</sub> in the design process as well as in the future use of the website.<a class="footnote"></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the image is necessary, we can ask ourselves what kind of image to include. In mockups, a grey placeholder with text or a vector graphic could be enough. If not, we can use an image compressor like <a href="imagecompressor.com">imagecompressor.com</a> to make the image smaller. Other tricks include making images black and white, and blurring the background to avail of pixel clustering technologies.<a class="footnote"></a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once designs are passed on for development, we can measure their impact on the planet. A solid first step is knowing the carbon footprint of what you’re working on. Developed by <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/">Wholegrain Digital</a>, the carbon calculator is a tool which estimates how much carbon your website emits <a href="http://www.websitecarbon.com">www.websitecarbon.com</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, you can analyse the frontend of your application using the Chrome Dev Tools plugin, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/greenit-analysis">GreenIT</a>. This plugin provides an <b>Ecoindex rating</b> as well as assessing the application’s performance against an outline of environmental best practices.<a class="footnote"></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From a user experience point of view, you can gauge the value of your product by using the previously mentioned <a href="https://gerrymcgovern.com/books/top-tasks-a-how-to-guide/">Top Tasks</a> methodology. Once your user's goals are established, you can assess how many steps it takes for a user to achieve their goal, and adjust your application so that time is as short as possible. This means your user is not fumbling around pages of your application, downloading data unnecessarily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, to figure out exactly how much data your user is downloaded per page, you can use the Chrome plugin <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-usage/dopfdeikfpadofngjnjokfgmboicnppc/related?hl=en-GB">Data Usage</a>.

                        Currently, the tech industry is responsible for <b>3.6% of the world’s carbon emissions</b>. This paper presents a sound basis for how we can begin to offset them:

                    <ul class="rainbow-list">

                        Working in the tech industry comes with many challenges as we try to solve problems which other sectors can’t.
