    <p>As the backbone of the information age, the tech sector has been growing exponentially. Unfortunately, it could be argued that the time and money we save in this current moment is stolen from our futures. Our daily activities produce greenhouse gases in such vast amounts that future generations of humans may not survive. If we continue living this way by 2030,
        <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="referenceButton" onclick="openReference(event, 'one')">1</a>
        “we will be in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control
        <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="referenceButton" onclick="openReference(event, 'two')">2</a>
        , that will most likely lead to the end of our civilisation as we know it.”
